"# videoStreaming"
put into one terminal python main.py
put into another terminal python -m http.server 8080

go to http://localhost:8080 in 2 windows
in one window type a name and click create room.
copy the code it gives you and put into the other window and hit join room
pick a video as the leader (the window you hit create room in) and push play
you should be able to see that it matches in the other window.
Play pause is a little finicky.
